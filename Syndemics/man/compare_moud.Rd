}
\arguments{

}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
  \item{\code{count_plot}}{ggplot object of monthly MOUD counts by treatment type (Old vs New)}
  \item{\code{difference_plot}}{ggplot object showing change in MOUD counts (New vs Old)}
  \item{\code{difference_data}}{Data frame with the following columns:

\description{
This function compares MOUD counts between an "old" and a "new" dataset.
It returns two plots and a data frame of count differences:
(1) A time series comparison by treatment type,
(2) A bar plot showing the difference in counts (new vs old),
(3) A data frame of differences by treatment type over time.
