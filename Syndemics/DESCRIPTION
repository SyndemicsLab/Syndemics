Description: The Syndemics Lab is a research unit with Boston Medical Center. 
    Our primary work involves dynamic simulations for predicting and analyzing opioid use disorder, HIV, and HEP-CE. 
    This package is a collection of commonly used workflow functionalizations serving analytic purposes and allowing outside users 
    easier access to interacting with the input and output structures for RESPOND <https://www.syndemicslab.org/respond>.
    As we update our models while receiving user input functions may change within this package.
