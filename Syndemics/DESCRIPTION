Description: Tools for dynamic simulation modeling and policy analysis of 
    opioid use disorder, HIV, and Hepatitis C epidemics. This package provides 
    workflow functions for interacting with RESPOND simulation models, enabling 
    users to perform simulated costing analysis of different policy interventions 
    and public health measures. The baseline primary function implements an 
    extended Capture-Recapture prevalence estimation method 
    as described in Barocas et al. (2018) doi:10.2105/AJPH.2018.304673, 
    accessible through the crc function, which estimates total background population. 
    Additional functions support input preparation and output analysis for dynamic epidemic simulations.
