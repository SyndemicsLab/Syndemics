Description: A collection of utility functions created to interact with the Syndemics Lab's data and models. 
    The two primary focuses of this package are the `CRC` function, which is used to preform capture-recapture analysis
    Wang J, Bernson D, et. al <doi:10.1016/j.lana.2024.100709> 
    which then provides the data for other shell-manipulation functions provided in this package through the other focus, 
    easily manipulating and setting up shell tables for the RESPOND model. RWMA Madushani, Jianing Wang, et. al <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0310763>
